Tc of algorithm: 
Sum of frequency count of each instruction that is, number of CPU computations.




Example:                         Frequencies

sum = 0                -------   (1)
for i in range(0,n+1): -------   (2n+1 ---- n increments, n+1 comparisions)
	sum+=i  			   (n)
return sum				   (1)

			total --- =    (3n+4) === O(n) - Degree of 3n+4
