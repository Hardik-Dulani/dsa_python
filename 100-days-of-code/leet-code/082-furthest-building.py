# 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach
# Medium
# Topics
# Companies
# Hint
# You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.

# You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

# While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),

# If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
# If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
# Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.
