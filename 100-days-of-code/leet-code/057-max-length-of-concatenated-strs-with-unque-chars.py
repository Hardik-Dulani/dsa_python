# 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters
# Medium

# You are given an array of strings arr. A string s is formed by the concatenation of a subsequence of arr that has unique characters.

# Return the maximum possible length of s.

# A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or 
# no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements
