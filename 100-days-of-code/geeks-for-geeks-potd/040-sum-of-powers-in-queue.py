# Techfest and the Queue

# A Techfest is underway, and each participant is given a ticket with a unique number. 
# Organizers decide to award prize points to everyone who has a ticket ID between a and b (inclusive). 
# The points given to a participant with ticket number x will be the sum of powers of the prime factors of x.

# For instance, if points are to be awarded to a participant with ticket number 12, 
# the amount of points given out will be equal to the sum of powers in the prime factorization of 12 (22 Ã— 31), which will be 2 + 1 = 3.

# Given a and b, determine the sum of all the points that will be awarded to the participants with ticket numbers between a and b (inclusive).
