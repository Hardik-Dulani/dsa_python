# Recamans sequence
# EasyAccuracy: 51.31%
# Given an integer n, return the first n elements of Recamanâ€™s sequence.
# It is a function with domain and co-domain as whole numbers. It is recursively defined as below:
# Specifically, let a(n) denote the (n+1)th term. (0 being the 1st term).
# The rule says:
# a(0) = 0
# a(n) = a(n-1) - n, if a(n-1) - n > 0 and is not included in the sequence previously
#        =  a(n-1) + n otherwise.

        for i in range(1,n):

            if x<0 or x in seen:
                dp[i]=x+i+i
                seen.add(x+i+i)
