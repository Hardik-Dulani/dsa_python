    "\n",
    "The Trapping Rain Water problem is a classic algorithmic problem that involves finding the amount of rainwater that can be trapped between buildings after it rains. The problem can be described using an array of non-negative integers where each element represents the height of a building. The goal is to calculate how much water can be trapped between the buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given `height`, an array of non-negative integers, where each element represents the height of a building at that position, the amount of water that can be trapped after raining is determined by the heights of the buildings and the gaps between them.\n",

    "To solve the Trapping Rain Water problem, you can use a two-pointer approach. Here’s how it works:\n",

    "1. **Initialize two pointers**:\n",
    "    - One pointer (`left`) starts at the beginning of the array.\n",
    "    - Another pointer (`right`) starts at the end of the array.\n",
    "2. **Track the maximum heights** seen from both ends:\n",
    "    - `left_max` is the maximum height encountered from the left.\n",
    "    - `right_max` is the maximum height encountered from the right.\n",
    "3. **Move the pointers towards each other**:\n",
    "    - At each step, compare the heights at the two pointers.\n",
    "    - If the height at the left pointer is less than or equal to the height at the right pointer:\n",
    "        - If the height at the left pointer is greater than `left_max`, update `left_max`.\n",
    "        - Otherwise, calculate the trapped water at the left pointer and add it to the total.\n",
    "        - Move the left pointer one step to the right.\n",
    "    - If the height at the right pointer is less than the height at the left pointer:\n",
    "        - If the height at the right pointer is greater than `right_max`, update `right_max`.\n",
    "        - Otherwise, calculate the trapped water at the right pointer and add it to the total.\n",
    "        - Move the right pointer one step to the left.\n",

    "### House robber\n",
    "\n",
    "The House Robber problem is a common algorithmic problem that can be solved using dynamic programming. The problem is described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, and you cannot rob two adjacent houses due to security systems that will alert the police. Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money in each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array `nums` where each element represents the amount of money in each house, you need to find the maximum amount of money you can rob without robbing two consecutive houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Solve the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a Dynamic Programming Array**:\n",
    "    - Create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the first `i` houses.\n",
    "2. **Initialize Base Cases**:\n",
    "    - If there are no houses (`nums` is empty), the maximum amount of money is 0.\n",
    "    - If there is only one house, the maximum amount of money is the amount in that house.\n",
    "3. **Iterate Through the Houses**:\n",
    "    - For each house, you have two choices: either rob the current house or skip it.\n",
    "    - If you rob the current house, you add the amount of money in the current house to the maximum amount robbed up to the house before the previous one (`dp[i-2]`).\n",
    "    - If you skip the current house, the maximum amount robbed up to the current house is the same as the previous house (`dp[i-1]`).\n",
    "    - The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])`.\n",

    "2. **Base Cases**:\n",
    "    - `dp[0]` is simply the amount of money in the first house.\n",
    "    - `dp[1]` is the maximum of the first two houses, as you can either rob the first or the second, but not both.\n",

    "### Toggle the Switch\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Toggle the Switch\" problem is a common problem that involves toggling the state of a series of switches. This problem is usually presented in a variety of forms, but the core idea remains the same: you have a series of switches that can be either ON or OFF, and you need to determine the final state of the switches after performing a series of toggle operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have `n` switches, all initially turned OFF. You perform a series of operations where in each operation, you toggle the state of every `k`-th switch (i.e., switches at positions that are multiples of `k`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example with 10 switches. Here's the sequence of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Toggle every switch (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ..., 10th).\n",
    "2. Toggle every 2nd switch (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th).\n",
    "3. Toggle every 3rd switch (3rd, 6th, 9th).\n",
    "4. Continue this pattern up to the `n`th switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "A switch ends up being toggled every time its position number is a multiple of the operation number. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Switch 6 will be toggled in operations 1, 2, 3, and 6 (since 6 is a multiple of these numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight here is to determine how many times each switch is toggled. A switch will be toggled in an operation if its position is a multiple of that operation number. The number of times a switch is toggled is equal to the number of its divisors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "A switch will be in the ON state after all operations if it is toggled an odd number of times. This happens if the number of divisors of the switch's position number is odd. This occurs only for perfect squares. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 (divisors: 1)\n",
    "- 4 (divisors: 1, 2, 4)\n",
    "- 9 (divisors: 1, 3, 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "Only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors because their square root is repeated exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a Python implementation to determine which switches will be ON after all the operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pythonCopy code\n",
    "def toggle_switches(n):\n",
    "    # Initialize all switches to OFF (False)\n",

    "\n",
    "    # Perform the toggle operations\n",
    "    for k in range(1, n + 1):\n",
    "        for j in range(k, n + 1, k):\n",
    "            switches[j] = not switches[j]\n",

    "print(f\"Switches that are ON after all operations: {result}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "    - We initialize a list `switches` of size `n+1` with all values set to `False` (representing all switches being OFF).\n",
    "2. **Toggle Operations**:\n",
    "    - We iterate over each `k` from 1 to `n`.\n",
    "    - For each `k`, we toggle the state of every `k`th switch (i.e., `k`, `2k`, `3k`, ..., `nk`) by setting `switches[j]` to `not switches[j]`.\n",
    "3. **Collect ON Switches**:\n",
    "    - We create a list `on_switches` that contains the positions of switches that are ON (`True`).\n",
    "4. **Result**:\n",
    "    - The function returns the list of positions of switches that are ON after all operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "Since only switches at perfect square positions will be ON, we can optimize the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pythonCopy code\n",
    "def toggle_switches_optimized(n):\n",
    "    # Only perfect squares will be ON\n",

    "### Explanation of the Optimized Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perfect Squares**:\n",
    "    - We iterate through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n`.\n",
    "    - We square each number to get the positions of the switches that will be ON.\n",
    "2. **Result**:\n",
    "    - The function returns the list of perfect squares up to `n`, which represents the positions of switches that are ON after all operations.\n",

    "Euler's Totient Function (often denoted as φ(n)) is an important function in number theory. It counts the number of integers up to n that are coprime with n. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1.\n",

    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given positive integer nnn, φ(n) is the number of integers from 1 to n that are coprime with n.\n",
